These are my miscellaneous video processing tools that I use to fine-tune SD models and curate pre-train data. Right now, this is just a refurbishment of my existing video splitter and frame deduper, however I plant to add a better version of a booru scraper in the future.

## Features

- Splitting videos into frames
- Customized thresholds and frame-skipping so that you can split how you like

## Setup
There are Windows executables provided in the releases tab, however you can build an executable from source:
```sh
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt

pyinstall main.py
```
Or, run the python scripts.
```sh
python -m venv venv

# windows
venv/scripts/activate

# unix 
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

python video_processor.py --input "path_to_your_videos_folder" --output output --skip 23 --verbose
```

This will iterate through each of the videos in your input folder and create a folder for them in the output location of your choosing. It will split each video into frames by your settings, and then remove duplicate frames.

Note: This script will not automatically delete credits and intros and whatnot from your video, so you will still have to manually delete some parts of your data.

## Requirements
- Operating System: Windows or UNIX-based (tested on Windows 10)
- Python (at least 3.8, tested on 3.10)

## Usage
For ease of use, I've included some command line flags so that you can run this multiple times without having to edit code directly:
- ``--input`` Required: The FULL PATH to the FOLDER with your images. Providing the link to a video itself will lead to an error, so make sure it is a folder.
- ``--output`` Optional: The FULL PATH to the FOLDER where you'd like the frames to be outputted to. By default, an output folder is created in the root directory.
- ``--skip`` Optional: The amount of frames to skip per second when splitting. For example, in a 24FPS video, 23 frames will be skipped and 1 will be kept per second. Avoids waste of storage and duplicates.
- ``--threshold`` Optional: The threshold (sensitivity) of deleting duplicates when deduplicating. **The higher the threshold, the stricter it is (and more duplicates will be removed). The recommended value for this is 10.
- ``--verbose`` Optional: Whether literally everything should be logged in the terminal. This will spam.
